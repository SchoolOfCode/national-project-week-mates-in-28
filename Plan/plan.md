The problem

- "It's difficult to find the resource when you're looking for one."
- "You understand when it was posted, in which lecture and what it was about."

MVP stage 1

- Database of links organised by week/day with a title/name.
- Page for table holding all resources.
- Search option by week. (different pages?)
- Form to add resource to database. Input fields for week/day and name/title.

MVP stage 2

- Tags for links.
- Add tags to input form.
- Search option for those tags.
- add links from Slack (links people have posted in slack)


MVP Stage ? (future aspirations)

- Implement accounts.
- Limit update/delete posts to original posting account+admins only.
